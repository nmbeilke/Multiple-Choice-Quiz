# Homework-Code-Quiz
Week 4 homework
## Description
This homework assignment required us to create a timed quiz application that allows a user to see questions, select an answer, see if they were correct or not, then view their score on a leaderboard. This app runs in the browser using interactive on-page buttons and updates the HTML, Bootstrap styles and CSS powered by JavaScript to display questions, a timer, scores and a leaderboard. 


We were given these accepence criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

  
- **What was your motivation?**
For this assignment, my motivation was to build a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that a user could gauge their progress compared to peers.

  
- **Why did you build this project?**
We built this project to get more comfortable with API frameworks like Bootstrap, Javascript logic as well as using it to change HTML and create a funtional tool.

- **What problem does it solve?**
This allows users to test their coding knowledge.

- **What did you learn?**
I learned how to get more comfortable with using Boostrap to create a quick, clean UI so that I could spend the majority of the development time configuring the Javascript.

- **What challenges did you encounter?**
The Javascript got unruly fast and solved this by using multiple files.
